Clp
=================

Interface to the **[Clp]** linear programming solver. Provides a basic ``linprog`` interface (see in-line comments) as well as a complete interface to the low-level C API. Very fresh, please report any issues.

## Todo

- Build on OS X
- "Build" on Windows
- Unified low-level interface to linear programming (like **[Osi]**)
- Improved linprog interface, allow some solver paramters and return more solution info

Contributions addressing any of these points (or others) are gladly accepted.
