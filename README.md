Clp
=================

Interface to the **[Clp]** linear programming solver. Provides a basic ``linprog`` interface (see in-line comments) as well as a complete interface to the low-level C API. This *should* work on Linux, OS X, and Windows (!), but it has not been widely tested. Please report any issues.

## Todo

- Unified low-level interface to linear programming (like **[Osi]**)
- Improved linprog interface, allow some solver paramters and return more solution info

Contributions addressing any of these points (or others) are gladly accepted.
